//! # Network Manager
//!
//! `NetworkManagerComponent` is the global ECS component that owns all runtime
//! **networking state** for the current engine instance (either server or client).
//!
//! It wraps the low-level networking primitives from `pill_core::networking`
//! (server/client sockets, transports) and provides a place to keep engine-side
//! policy and glue (spawn/despawn handlers, interpolation hook, tick cadence,
//! reconnect backoff, etc.).
//!
//! ## Responsibilities
//! - Initialize and hold either **server** or **client** state ([`NetworkSide`]),
//! - Track connection lifecycle ([`ConnectionState`], reconnect intent/backoff),
//! - Maintain world epoch and per-connection sequence,
//! - Provide **typed hooks** for engine-level spawn/despawn/interpolation,
//! - Drive update cadence via [`NetworkManagerComponent::tick`], [`NetworkManagerComponent::accumulator`], and [`NetworkManagerComponent::timeout`].
//!
//! ## Typical usage
//! - **Server:** [`NetworkManagerComponent::new_server`] → create the server object with given
//!   address and max clients, then per-frame drive the server side.
//! - **Client:** [`NetworkManagerComponent::new_client`] → create the client object with given
//!   client ID and server address to connect to, then per-frame drive the client side.
//!
//! See also: `pill_core::networking` (packet format, transports, send/receive) and
//! `pill_engine::systems::networking` for details on networking implementation.

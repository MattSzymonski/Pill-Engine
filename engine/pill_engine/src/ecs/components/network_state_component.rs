//! # NetworkStateComponent (replication metadata per entity)
//!
//! `NetworkStateComponent` describes **what to replicate** about an entity and
//! **how it participates** in the networking lifecycle. It’s attached to every
//! entity that should be visible to the networking layer (spawn/despawn/updates).
//!
//! See also:
//! - `pill_engine::ecs::components::network_manager_component::NetworkManagerComponent`
//!   (drives the replication pipeline).
//! - `pill_core::networking` (wire format, client/server wrappers).
//! - `pill_engine::ecs::systems::networking_system.rs` (networking systems implementation).
